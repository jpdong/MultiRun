## What's New in Version 1.0.30.20?

We're excited to announce the release of Multi Run version 1.0.30.20! This update is packed with new features, performance enhancements, and bug fixes to improve your experience. Here’s a look at what’s new.

### 1. Easy Cache Clearing

To help you keep the app running smoothly and free up valuable storage space, we've introduced a new **cache clearing** feature.

You can now easily clear the app's cache by simply **long-pressing the app icon** on your home screen. A "Clear Cache" option will appear. Tapping it will instantly remove temporary files, which can help resolve issues and improve performance.

### 2. Integrated QR & Barcode Scanner

We're making Multi Run even more versatile with the addition of a built-in **QR and barcode scanner**.

Now you can scan codes directly within the app without needing to switch to a separate scanner application. It's fast, convenient, and ready when you need it.

### 3. Crash Fixes and Performance Optimizations

As with every update, we've been hard at work squashing bugs and improving stability. This release includes several **crash fixes** and **performance optimizations** to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience for all users.

Thank you for using Multi Run! We're committed to continuously improving the app and adding features that you'll love.
