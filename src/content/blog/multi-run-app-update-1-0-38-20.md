We're excited to announce the release of Multi Run version 1.0.38.20! This update brings some frequently requested features, important bug fixes, and improved compliance with European privacy regulations.

### System App Filter

Many users have told us that they couldn't find the apps they wanted to clone. We've discovered that in many cases, these were system applications that Multi Run wasn't scanning by default.

To address this, we've added a new **"Filter System Apps"** toggle on the "Add App" page. Now, you have the power to decide whether or not to include system apps in the scan. This should make it much easier to find and clone the apps you need.

### Crash and Performance Fixes

We've been hard at work squashing bugs and improving performance. This update addresses several issues that were causing crashes and lag for some users. You should experience a smoother and more stable Multi Run with this new version.

### UMP SDK Integration

To better comply with European data protection regulations (like GDPR), we have integrated the User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK. This will provide users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK with more transparent choices about how their data is used for advertising.
