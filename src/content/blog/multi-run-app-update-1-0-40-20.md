We are thrilled to announce the rollout of **Multi-Run App version 1.0.40.20**. While our previous update introduced exciting new features like the subscription service and the Secret Zone, this release is laser-focused on refining the core experience. We believe that a stable, smooth application is just as important as a feature-rich one.

In addition to performance enhancements, we are dedicating a significant portion of this post to addressing a common question from our community: **"How do I manage or cancel my subscription?"** We believe in full transparency and want to ensure you have complete control over your app experience.

### Version 1.0.40.20: A Focus on Stability

Our engineering team has spent the last few weeks analyzing crash reports and performance metrics. Version 1.0.40.20 brings critical fixes that significantly improve the reliability of the Multi-Run App.

#### 1. Eliminating Crashes
We identified a memory management issue that was causing the app to unexpectedly close (crash) on certain devices, particularly when running resource-intensive games like **Roblox** or **Free Fire** alongside social media apps. 
*   **The Fix:** We've optimized how background processes are handled, ensuring that the app releases unused memory more efficiently. This dramatically reduces the likelihood of crashes during heavy multitasking sessions.

#### 2. Smoothing Out the Lag
Users reported occasional "stuttering" or lag when switching between cloned accounts or when launching a new clone. 
*   **The Fix:** We have refactored the app launching sequence to be more lightweight. You should now notice a snappier response time when tapping on an icon, and smoother transitions when swiping between your dual accounts.

### Listening to You: The Subscription Question

Since the launch of our subscription service (which removes ads and unlocks the Secret Zone), we've received some feedback from users who were unsure how to manage their subscription settings. 

We want to be crystal clear: **We do not want you to feel "trapped" in a subscription.** If the service isn't right for you, or if you just wanted to try the free trial, you have the absolute right to cancel it easily. Since all payments are processed securely through **Google Play**, the cancellation process is handled entirely within the Google Play Store app, not inside Multi-Run itself. This ensures your financial data remains secure and under your control.

### Step-by-Step Guide: How to Cancel Your Subscription

If you wish to cancel your Multi-Run subscription, please follow these official steps provided by Google Play. You can do this at any time.

#### Method 1: On your Android Phone or Tablet

1.  **Open the Google Play Store App**
    Find the Google Play icon on your home screen or app drawer and tap to open it.

2.  **Tap Your Profile Icon**
    Look for your profile picture or initial in the top right corner of the screen.

3.  **Select "Payments & subscriptions"**
    In the menu that appears, tap on **Payments & subscriptions**.

4.  **Tap "Subscriptions"**
    You will see a list of options; select **Subscriptions**. This will show you all the active subscriptions linked to your Google account.

5.  **Select "Multi Run"**
    Find **Multi Run** in the list and tap on it.

6.  **Tap "Cancel subscription"**
    At the bottom of the screen, tap the **Cancel subscription** button.

7.  **Follow the Instructions**
    Google might ask you why you are cancelling (you can choose "Decline to answer" or any other reason). Follow the on-screen prompts to confirm the cancellation.

#### Method 2: On your Computer

1.  Go to [play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions](https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions).
2.  Make sure you are signed in to the correct Google Account (the one you used to subscribe).
3.  Find **Multi Run** in the list.
4.  Click **Manage**.
5.  Click **Cancel Subscription** and confirm.

### Common Questions & Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see "Multi Run" in my subscriptions list.**
*   **Check your account:** Ensure you are logged into the Google Play Store with the *same* Google Account you used to make the purchase. If you have multiple Google accounts on your phone, switch between them in the Play Store profile menu.
*   **Already canceled?** If it appears in an "Expired" or "Canceled" list, you have already successfully stopped the subscription.

**Q: What happens after I cancel?**
*   **You keep access:** If you cancel today but your subscription period ends next week, you will *still* have access to all premium features (Ad-Free, Secret Zone, etc.) until that date.
*   **No future charges:** Once canceled, you will not be charged again unless you choose to resubscribe.

**Q: Can I get a refund?**
*   Refunds are handled directly by Google Play's policies. You generally have a 48-hour window to request a refund through the Play Store if you subscribed by mistake.
